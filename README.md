Will contain inevitable spoilers!  Divert your eyeballs.


big lessons so far:
-i/o is very limited (start w/ 2 chips)
-discrete logic outside of chips gets confusing fast.
-propagation delay always matters 
-therefore don't overcomplicate your solutions
-and solve the problem in front of you, not the next one
