### big lessons so far:
- i/o is very limited (start w/ 2 chips)
- discrete logic outside of chips gets confusing fast.
- propagation delay always matters 
- therefore don't overcomplicate your solutions
- and solve the problem in front of you, not the next one

### hints:
-L2 subway token -- think mechanical turk
